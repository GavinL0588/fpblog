Blog Entry # 1						     Date: 12/9/19


Today I am creating my prototype for my website (Where are you at in the process of your product? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

I learned how to create a draft for my blog post  (What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project? How will you use the synthesis practice we did today on your project?)

I used google to find the sourses(What sources did you use to learn that? Some days this will just be class instruction.)

A skill that I used was github, HTML, CSS, etc.   How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills
